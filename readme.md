Overview
========
This is the README file for the Dungeon Crawler game. Dungeon Crawler is a
simple graphical dungeon crawler inspired by historical roguelikes mixed with
modern and unqiue new game design. Explore procedurally generated worlds
filled with random dungeons housing epic loot, stake out a portion of the
unforgiving wild wildness to call your own and live to tell the tales of your
exploits! Just try not to die :)

Game Requirements
=================

 * Windows 7+ (It should work on Vista, has not been tested)
 * Microsoft .NET 4.0 (Installer provided)
 * Microsoft XNA 4 (Installer provided)

Building Requirements
=====================
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or 2012
 * Microsoft .NET 4.0
 * Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0
 * Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)

Development Notes
=================
Development work has ceased on the main C++ development branch. I am currently
attempting to rebuild the game using C# and the XNA framework. This work can be
viewed on the XNAPROTO branch. All work is going into character interaction
(movement, attacking, items, user interface) at the moment, since I have already
built a dungeon generation system in C++. That will be the last feature that gets
added.

Contributions
=============

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged! At the moment the project
is in a heavy state of flux (seeing as it is only barely playable), so it might
be difficult to contribute new code right now.

Not a programmer? Fear not! I would love for any of the following contributions:

    1. Bug reports... let me know if something breaks or isn't right
    2. Artwork for the game (I NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF ARTWORK!)
    3. Content for the game (Mobs, weapons, magic, all sorts of stuff)
    4. Sound and music
    5. Documentation
    6. Play testing and game balancing
	
Comments and feedback!! Even if it was just "meh", I would like to know someone tried it out :)

Forward all contributions, inquiries, comments and flames to: scott@whitespaceconsideredharmful.com
