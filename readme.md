Overview
========
This is the README file for the Dungeon Crawler game. Dungeon Crawler is a
simple graphical dungeon crawler inspired by historical roguelikes mixed with
modern and unqiue new game design. Explore procedurally generated worlds
filled with random dungeons housing epic loot, stake out a portion of the
unforgiving wild wildness to call your own and live to tell the tales of your
exploits! Just try not to die :)

Game Requirements
=================

 * Windows 7 or newer
 * Microsoft .NET 4.6 (Installer provided)

Building Requirements
=====================
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (15.3 or later)

Development Notes
=================
Development on the XNAPROTO branch has been succesfull and has been merged back into master. The game now has character movement, and dungeon generation. Next steps are basic combat, world generation, level loading and level transferring.

Contributions
=============

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged! At the moment the project
is in a heavy state of flux (seeing as it is only barely playable), so it might
be difficult to contribute new code right now.

Not a programmer? Fear not! I would love for any of the following contributions:

    1. Bug reports... let me know if something breaks or isn't right
    2. Artwork for the game (I NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF ARTWORK!)
    3. Content for the game (Mobs, weapons, magic, all sorts of stuff)
    4. Sound and music
    5. Documentation
    6. Play testing and game balancing
	
Comments and feedback!! Even if it was just "meh", I would like to know someone tried it out :)

Forward all contributions, inquiries, comments and flames to: scott@smacdo.com
