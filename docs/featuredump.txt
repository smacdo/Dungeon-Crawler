Braindump of features and whatnot
==================================



Time
----
The game should keep track of time, including how long a turn lasts
(i'd say 10 seconds), how long a day/night is, what minute, hour, day,
month and year the game is. There should be holidays and other special
events. Game should recogonize sunrise, sunset, middway, midnight, dawn,
dust, night, day, etc.

Traps
-----
We need traps! Lots of traps! Both natural (rock slides, bottomless hole)
and unnatural (spiked bear trap)

Noise
-----
Players and monsters all make noise, which can be heard by the player after
making a hearing check. They flow a certain distance, and will alert monsters
who are idle. Monsters could possibly move in the direction of the sound,
searching for who ever made it

Smell
-----
Monsters and players leave occasionally (or maybe often) leave smells
on tiles which can be picked up by the appropriate check. Passive checks
will pick this up a lot less than an active check. A smell will dissipate
over time, depending on its original strength


Hunger
------
Monsters and players will get hungry. The majority of the time (80%) the
player is either fully satisified, or barely hungry. After this point, there
will be increasingly powerful side effects as he/she gets more hungry. Note
that as each state gets worse, the time it takes to progress is much longer.
Also, the majority of food will quickly fill up the food bar. This is in an
attempt to make hunger not annoying, but still interesting especially if the
player is caught out in the wilderness trying to scavenge for food.

An idea for hunger: 
    100:        Food Coma                       -speed, int
    95:         Stuffed        
    60:         Full            
    40:         Not hungry       
    30:         Slightly hungry   
    20:         Hungry             
    15:         Hunger pangs      
    10:         Empty Stomach
    0:          Ravenous
    -10:        Famished                        - more suscp. to crit hit
    -20:        Starving                        - randomly lose a turn
    -30:        Extreme starvation              - magic casts fail
    -40:        Near death starvation
    -50:        Death


Something like:
    Turkey, gravey and bread meal:   +80 food

Room Adjectives
---------------
These things should be influences on the room is designed:
    * sizes: tiny, small, medium, large, huge, gigantic
    * several (10-25%) of rooms should be "interesting", rest should
      be filler or maybe one/two small visual/feature things. We want the
      game to be consistenly novel, but not so much that each room is
      different! Otherwise player gets bored... make them work for it
    * room types: normal, vault (lesser, greater), star burst,
                  fractal, lair, burrow, monster pit, monster town,
                  concave, lake, tower

Interesting Features
--------------------
    * Portal: it summons unworldly creatures in, player could enter it
      to see what is on the other side. Could be nothing, super monsters,
      with legendary loot, could be huge and empty, etc.
