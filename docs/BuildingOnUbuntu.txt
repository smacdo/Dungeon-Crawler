Building Dungeon Crawler
=========================


On Ubuntu Linux
-------------------------
Ubuntu Linux is Dungeon Crawler's officially supported linux distribution. The project requires Ubuntu 11.10 ("Oneiric Ocelot"), along with the following list of packages. Don't let the instructions intimidate you... there might be a lot, but they're simple.

### Building SDL2
Let's do the most complicated part first - installing SDL2. SDL2 is still very much in development, so there are no official ubuntu packages for it. No matter! We shall build and install from source control. Make sure mercurial is installed!

    sudo aptitude install mercurial

Now change directory to your temporary directory. We will check out the build files here.

    cd /tmp

Check out all of the SDL libraries used by Dungeon Crawler

    hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/
    hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image/
    hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf/

To build these libraries, we will first need to install their dependencies. Run the next apt command:

    sudo aptitude install build-essential make autoconf automake libtool libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libaudio-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxxf86vm-dev libxss-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libesd0-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libsmpeg-dev libflac-dev libmikmod2-dev libfreetype6-dev

Now to build SDL

    cd /tmp/SDL
    ./autogen.sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure
    make
    sudo make install

Repeat the steps for SDL_image

    cd /tmp/SDL_image
    ./autogen.sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure
    make
    sudo make install

Again, repeat the same steps for SDL_ttf

    cd /tmp/SDL_ttf
    ./autogen.sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure
    make
    sudo make install

Onward to building the actual game!

### Building the game client
Dungeon Client uses git for version control, and cmake for its build system. We'll need to install both before proceeding:

    sudo aptitude install git cmake

Don't forget to install the game's library dependencies too. Stick with me, we're getting there!

    sudo aptitude install libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev

Now we can build the game client. All that preparation work, and now we can finally start building the actual game code :)

    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/smacdo/Dungeon-Crawler.git
    cd Dungeon-Crawler
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make

And finally... the magic step that will run your game:

    make run

If you've made it this far, you deserve a cookie. Once the project gets more advanced (meaning it actually resembles a game), I'll sit down a build debian packages to automate this whole nasty process.
