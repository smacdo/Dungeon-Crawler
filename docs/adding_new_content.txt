A lot of this is temporary and even possibly out of date! I created this
file as a way for new contributers to add content to the game... also as an
incentive for me to stop hardcoding game data and move it into data files :)

Adding a new tile
======================================================
 - Load tiletype.h, and add a definition to ETileType. This value will be the
   ID for your new tile
 - Modify tilefactory.cpp. Look at the lines for the other tile types, and copy
   what they've done
 - Modify clientview.cpp, near the lines that start with
   mTileSprites[ ETILETYPE... ]. The array value is the tile's ID and the
   string parameter to createSprite is the name of the sprite
