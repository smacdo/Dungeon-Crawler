Things to do in the future, once we get a basic framework going
	- Game polls input manager and directly acts on that. Instead,
	  the input manager should create command objects and return those
	  to the game for execution.
	- Refactor the game to stop using (int x, int y) and instead use the
	  Point class
	- Refactor the older code still sing row/col notation and just use
	  x/y
