Very important
====================

 - Change RectF, Transform and gameplay code to use a center origin system with an inverted Y axis rather  than the
   current top left origin.
 - Remove Offset from Collision component once using center rather than top left.
 - Only spawn enemies if the area is clear (check collision).
 - Combine the physics movemnet and collision processors into a Physics component (physics moves and collision checks).
 - Create a struct based iterator for collision checks for high performance queries.
 - Remove actor "facing" direction and instead use Rotation. Need to change weapon code to handle this!
   - Adjust how sprite selects animation direction with respect to transform rotation. Should use Right/Left in most
     cases rather than Up/Down.
