Very important
====================

- Remove IGameObject
- Merge Core and Engine
 - Only spawn enemies if the area is clear (check collision).
 - Remove actor "facing" direction and instead use Rotation. Need to change weapon code to handle this!
   - Adjust how sprite selects animation direction with respect to transform rotation. Should use Right/Left in most
     cases rather than Up/Down.
