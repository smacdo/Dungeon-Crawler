Build
------------------------------------------------
 * Client building to wrong directory:
   - should be: 
   - but is: build\DungeonCrawler.Client\x86\Debug
 * Asset copy script is using the wrong variable because its not copying to new (wrong) dir.

Combat
------------------------------------------------
* Melee does damage
* Bow firing + spawn arrow -> refire support (keep firing without letting up)
  * Fix animation to include putting pack
  * Add single shot animation (pull out, fire, put back)
  * Add multiple shot animation
* Spell casting
* Health and death system

Systems
------------------------------------------------
Add events to sprite animation files and rewrite melee/bow/spell to use events rather than hardcode
the frames

Gameplay
------------------------------------------------
 * Only spawn enemies if the area is clear (check collision).

Levels and Data Loading
------------------------------------------------
* Tile grid with collision
* Load Tiled maps
* Switch between maps
* Better asset pipeline

Debugging
------------------------------------------------
* Draw: GC.GetTotalMemory() on screen.
* performance overlay
    * frames/sec
    * update speed
    * draw speed
    * num sprites drawn
